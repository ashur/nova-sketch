[plugins]: https://developer.sketch.com/plugins
[Nova]: https://nova.app

## Usage

Let's say we're using Nova to develop a Sketch plugin called **Palettes** that has a couple of commands, **Import Palette...** and **Export Palette...**. Testing changes to either command's handler might look like this:

1. Make changes in Nova
1. Switch back to Sketch
1. Open **Plugins â†’ Palettes**
1. Select the command to run it

Not too bad, but we can remove a little bit of friction in our development workflow!

**Run in Sketch** makes any [plugin command] defined in `Contents/Sketch/manifest.json` available as a Nova task automatically ðŸ’Žâœ¨

1. Double-click `Run in Sketch.novaextension`
1. Click **Install**

## Configuration

By default, **Run in Sketch** looks for Sketch in the `/Applications` folder.

To specify an alternate location, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Run in Sketch's **Preferences** tab:
